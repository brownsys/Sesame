* alohomora_derive: causes dependency issues with indexmap dependency and rust version
* things removed from core that we should be careful about keeping in extensions:
   * src/bbox/bbox_render.rs
   * parts of src/context/mod.rs that have to do with constructing context from a rocket request
   * FrontendPolicy and its implementations in policies/{policy_and,policy_or,no_policy}.rs and in testing/test_policy.rs
   * SchemaPolicy and its implementations in policies/{policy_and,policy_or,no_policy}.rs and in testing/test_policy.rs
   * src/policy.policy.rs Reason DB reason used to have mysql::Values.
   * testing/{client, test_route}.rs: need to keep in rocket
   * testing/test_context.rs the part about constructing this from Rocket requests
* end to end tests:
   * tests/orm.rs to orm
   * other tests to rocket
